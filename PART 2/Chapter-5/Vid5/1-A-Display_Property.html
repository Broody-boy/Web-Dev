<!-- The display property of an element can have these values:
1) Block: The element takes up the whole width of the scren, so effectively blocking out any other elements from sitting next to it either on the left or right.
2) Inline: The element takes only that much space in height as well as width as is required.
NOTE: Block elements can be specified a width but still they'll blocking out any other elements from sitting next to it either on the left or right.
    However, for inline elements, you can't change their width.
    So what if i want to add an element that can occupy the same line but at the same time i can set their widths?
    Solution: To get the best of both worlds, you can use Inline-block:
3) Inline-Block: 
4) None: Gets rid of the element i.e. It makes the webpage appear as if the element didn't exist.

NOTE: Setting the visibility: hidden leaves the corresponding space, corresponding to the element, as empty.
But setting the display: none does not leave any empty space. Instead, it makes the webpage appear as if the element didn't exist.

<!--Tags that are block elements by default:
1) Paragraph - p tag.
2) Headers - All h1 to h6.
3) Divisions - div tag.
4) List and list items - ol, ul, li tag.
5) Forms - form tag.

<!--Tags that are inline elements by default:
1) Span - span tag.
2) Images - img tag.
3) Anchors - a tag.

    <p>This is an example of block display element, which will span whole screen width:</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red;">Hello</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red;">World</p>

    <p>Now, inline elements:</p>
    <span style = "background-color: blue;">Hello</span>
    <span style = "background-color: blue;">World</span>
    <span style = "background-color: blue;">Hello</span>
    <span style = "background-color: blue;">World</span>

    <p>Block turned to inline:</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red; display: inline;">Hello</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red; display: inline;">World</p>

    <p>Inline turned to block:</p>
    <span style = "background-color: blue; display: block;">Hello</span>
    <span style = "background-color: blue; display: block;">World</span>
    
    <p>Block elements can be specified a width but still they'll occupy a single line:</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red; width: 100px;">Hello</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red; width: 100px;">World</p>

    <p>Inline elements do not change size even on specifying a width</p>
    <span style = "background-color: blue; width: 100px;">Hello</span>
    <span style = "background-color: blue; width: 100px;">World</span>

    <p>So the Solution is using inline-block. Now you can have elements on the same line as well as you can change their width ðŸ˜‰:</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red; display:inline-block; width: 100px;">Hello</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red; display: inline-block; width: 100px;">World</p>
