<!-- DEFAULT HTML positioning rules:
    1) Content is everything: For inline elements, their height and width both are determined by the content length, its font.
        For block elements, even though their width remains same(i.e. the entire scren), its height is determined by the font of the content.
    2) Order of elements on screen comes from the HTML code you write.
    3) Children sit on top of parents:
        <div>
            <h1>a <span>pro</span>grammer</h1>
        </div>
        Here, span sits on h1 which further sits on div

<!-- The position property of an element can have these values:
    1) Static: Static implies go along with the default HTML positioning rules. This is the default value for the position property.
    2) Relative: It positions the element relative to how it would have been positioned had it been static.
        img{
            position: relative;
            left: 30px; //pushes the image 30px away from the left of the previous position where it used to be, i.e. pushes it 30px to the right. 
        }
        So:
            left: 20px;  //Gets pushed right 20px.
            right: 20px; //Gets pushed left 20px.
            top: 20px;   //Gets pushed bottom 20px.
            bottom: 20px;//Gets pushed top 20px.
        NOTE: On moving the element, the other elements remain in place. i.e., it might occur that the element being moved gets above another element and covers it.
    3) Absolute: It positions the element relative to its parent.
        So:
        img{
                position: absolute;
                right: 20px;    //would position the image 20px from the right border of the body(if body is the parent).
        }
        NOTE: On moving the element, other elements change their position to fill the space created.
    4) Fixed: It makes the element fixed at its position, even on scrolling.
