/*To center elements, use text-align: center. But this works only for two cases:
                         a) elements that inline-block (such as img tag)
                         b) block elements (such as h1 or p tags) whose width has been left default.
                            So, this does not work:
                            h1{
                                width: 10%;
                                text-align: center; //h1 will not be centered even on writing this as its width has been changed from the default.
                            }
   So what will we do if a block element has a width set? Use margins to center such an element:
                            h1{
                                width: 10%;
                                margin: 0 auto 0 auto; //margins in order: margin top is 0, margin right is auto, margin bottom is 0, margin left is auto.
                            }
*/

/*Same thing, better written:
    text-align: center; written inside a parent centers all its children which are inline-block or block and do not have their width set.
    If a block element has a width set, you have to center it using the auto value for the margin.
