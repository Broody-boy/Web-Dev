<!--The location where CSS and JS are added matters: The browser always reads from top to bottom.
    Here, in this example, when it encounters the JS script, it is not able to find the h1 and thus the JS does not function.
    Moreover, the CSS styles are applied much later, when the browser reaches that line.

    So, as a rule:
    1) It is better to put CSS in the head. (not talking of inline CSS).
    2) Always put JS in the end of body. (not talking of inline JS), as it might happen that a tag whose value is being tried to changed isn't on the scren yet (see the example below - h1 is not there on the scren at the time JS gets executed.).
        Another benefit this will offer is that it will make the website load faster:
        Atleast the HTML and CSS will get rendered and the JS can be executed even afterwards.
        Otherwise, some time will get spent in reading through the script and would delay the rendering of HTML and CSS, making the website look slow

<!--Thus, JS is added at the last of body. And It is good to add CSS in the head section.-->
