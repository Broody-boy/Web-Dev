<!--Selectors can be combined in three ways:

1) Multiple selectors:
    e.g:
        h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6{             //Change font-family of all h1s, h2s, h3s, h4s, h5s, h6s to Montserrat. 
            font-family: "Montserrat";
        }

2) Hierarchial Selectors: parent_selector child_selector{...}   //Space is there in between the selectors.
    e.g:
        #container .title-text {           //Change text-align of ALL the "title-text"s classes contained in the element with its id as "container" to left.
            text-align: left;
        }
    
    Another example:
        div h1{                             //Change color of ALL "h1"s that are present in ALL "div" elements to red.
            color: red;
        }

    Yet another example:
        .container-element h1{              //Change color of ALL h1s present in ALL elements WITH CLASS "container" to red.
            color red;
        }

    NOTE: It is useless to use an id for the child as id will already be unique:
        #parent #child {
            text-align: left;
        }
    is useless as the same can be done using just the child's id:
        #child {
            text-align: left;
        }

3) Literally Combined selectors: selector1.selector2{...} or selector1#selector2{...}    //No space in between the selectors
    e.g:
        div.container-fluid{    //Apply the style to all divs that have the class container-fluid.
            color: red;
        }
        //This might be useful when there are two or more different html tags(e.g. h1 and p) having the same class(e.g. shown-red) and we want to target only one tag out of those.
    
    Another example:
        .reddened.centered{    //Apply the style to all elements that have the class reddened as well as the class centered.
            color: red;
            text-align: center;
        }
