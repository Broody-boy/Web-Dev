    1) Id selector are more specific than Class selectors which are more specific than Tag selectors.
        Thus, priority: Id > Class > Tag selector.
    2) But we also know that inline css is more specific than internal css which is more specific than external css.
        Thus, priority: Inline > Internal > External CSS.
    
    This creates room for conflicts in CSS attributes.
    Hence, follow these points:
    A) Abstain from using id selectors, unless absolutely needed(like in a carousel button to target the sought carousel).
    B) Don't use id selectors just because there is a single element which needs to be styled. Use class instead.
    C) Try to avoid multiple classes for an element as it may lead to conflicts.
    D) Never use inline CSS. It is not a good programming practice.
