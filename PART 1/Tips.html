    1) Don't put space in between: 3 rem is wrong. 3rem is correct. Similarly, 3 % is also wrong.
    2) Line height does not have units (like px or rem etc.), it is simply used like: line-height: 1.5.
    3) Bootstrap is not meant to be installed. Instead, it is just included.
    4) I will be using the older Bootstrap v4.0.0, same as that used in the course.
    5) To make an image fully round, use the following css: border-radius: 100%;
    6) just writing img.png will search for img.png in the same folder as the current html file.
    7) / refers to root.
    8) ../ moves one folder upwards in the folder hierarchy.
